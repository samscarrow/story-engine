**FADE IN:**

**COLD OPEN**

**INT. MOUNTAIN SHRINE, SAMNIUM - NIGHT**

Complete darkness. Sound of dripping water. Heavy, ragged breathing.

A spark. Flint on steel. A torch flares to life, revealing PONTIUS PILATE (28), face bloodied, Roman armor torn and muddied. He's not alone in this cave shrine.

Ancient weapons hang on stone walls. Samnite gladii, their blades still sharp despite rust. Spears that killed Romans centuries ago. An altar bears Oscan inscriptions, worn by centuries but still legible.

Pilate approaches the altar with reverence and revulsion. He places something on the stone - a Roman military commendation, bronze eagle gleaming in torchlight. His hand shakes. Blood drips from his palm onto the ancient stone.

**PILATE**  
*(whispered Oscan, subtitled)*  
I am your blood, grandfather. But I will not be your fate.

A sound behind him. Scrape of metal on stone. He spins.

YOUNG SAMNITE WARRIORS emerge from shadows, five of them, weapons drawn. Their leader (20s) has the same strong jaw as Pilate - distant cousin, perhaps.

**YOUNG SAMNITE**  
*(in Oscan, subtitled)*  
Blood traitor. You wear their armor to our sacred place.

**PILATE**  
*(in Oscan, subtitled)*  
I wear what I must to survive.

**YOUNG SAMNITE**  
Your grandfather died rather than wear it.

They circle him. Pilate doesn't draw his gladius, but his stance shifts - weight balanced, ready.

**PILATE**  
Then my grandfather was a fool.

The Young Samnite ATTACKS—

**SMASH CUT TO:**

**TITLE SEQUENCE: "PONTIUS"**

---

**ACT ONE**

**INT. ROMAN SENATE HOUSE - ANTECHAMBER - DAY**

**TITLE: "ROME - THREE DAYS LATER"**

Marble columns soar toward painted ceilings depicting Roman victories. The antechamber bustles with PETITIONERS, CLIENTS, and SENATORS conducting the empire's business.

Pilate waits among them, still in military dress but cleaned up. His face bears healing cuts from the mountain encounter - a split lip, a gash above his eyebrow. He stands apart, neither mingling nor cowering.

A SENIOR SENATOR (60s, patrician bearing) passes, stops, studies Pilate's face with the intensity of a collector examining a rare coin.

**SENATOR**  
That's a Samnite jaw if I ever saw one. The bones never lie. You're Pontii, aren't you?

The room's attention shifts like iron filings to a magnet. Other SENATORS drift closer, conversations dying.

**PILATE**  
Pontius Pilate. Returning from Germanic campaigns.

**SENATOR**  
Pontius! *(louder, performing for the room)* Gentlemen, we have royalty among us! The clan of Gaius Pontius - the Humiliator of Caudine Forks. 

He circles Pilate like a gladiator in the arena.

**SENATOR** *(CONT'D)*  
Your ancestor made three hundred Roman nobles crawl under the yoke like cattle. We still teach it to our children - the worst humiliation in Roman history.

**YOUNG NOBLE**  
*(joining in)*  
And Pontius Telesinus! The Samnite butcher who tried to burn Rome with Sulla still in living memory.

**SENATOR**  
*(to Pilate)*  
Your grandfather rode with Telesinus at the Colline Gate, didn't he? Died trying to destroy everything we've built.

**PILATE**  
*(controlled)*  
My grandfather died forty years ago. With the past.

**SECOND SENATOR**  
The past? *(laughing)* The past never dies with your people. My own father killed Samnites at the Colline Gate. Perhaps he killed yours, Pilate. Perhaps I'm speaking to the son of a man my father butchered.

The room watches like spectators at the games. Pilate stands perfectly still, absorbing each insult like blows.

**YOUNG NOBLE**  
Tell us, Pontius - when you saved the Third Legion's Eagle in Germania, did you fight like a Roman? Or like the mountain savage you really are?

Pilate's eye twitches. They know about Germania.

**SENATOR**  
We heard you were shouting in Oscan. Like your grandfather at the Colline Gate. Like an animal reverting to its nature.

---

**FLASHBACK - EXT. GERMANIC FOREST - DAWN (ONE YEAR EARLIER)**

Quick, brutal flashes:

Rain and fog. The Roman patrol moves through massive oaks. Pilate leads six AUXILIARIES - the outsiders of Rome's army.

Germanic WAR CRIES shatter the morning. WARRIORS emerge from fog like demons - painted, huge, screaming.

Arrows fly. The Greek auxiliary takes one in the throat, falls gurgling.

**PILATE**  
*(screaming in Oscan)*  
Meddís! Meddís ver sacrum!

He catches himself, switches to Latin—

**PILATE** *(CONT'D)*  
Form square! Form square!

But it's chaos. Romans falling everywhere. A GERMANIC CHIEFTAIN charges Pilate. They clash - the German is stronger, but Pilate fights with non-Roman techniques. Mountain fighting. Dirty. Vicious.

He tears the chieftain's throat out with his teeth.

The THIRD LEGION'S EAGLE STANDARD falls as the signifer dies. Pilate dives for it, catches it before it hits the mud. A Batavian auxiliary tries to run - Pilate kills him without hesitation.

**PILATE** *(CONT'D)*  
No one runs while the Eagle stands!

Blood everywhere. Romans dying. Germans pressing in.

Then - HORNS. SEJANUS arrives with reinforcements. The Germans retreat.

Pilate stands alone among corpses, still holding the Eagle, drenched in blood - Roman, German, his own.

---

**BACK TO SENATE ANTECHAMBER:**

**SENATOR**  
So you saved the Eagle. But which Rome were you saving it for? The one that exists? Or the one your people still dream of destroying?

**PILATE**  
I am a citizen. I serve the Senate and People of Rome.

**SENATOR**  
You're a Samnite wearing a Roman mask. And masks always slip. *(stepping closer)* Tell me, Pontius - when you're alone, when you pour libations, is it to Jupiter? Or to those mountain gods your grandfather died defending?

Before Pilate can answer, a TRIBUNE enters.

**TRIBUNE**  
Pilate? Sejanus will see you now.

The name 'Sejanus' shifts the room's energy like a cold wind. The Senators step back.

**SENATOR**  
*(lower, venomous)*  
Sejanus's new pet. Of course. He does love collecting exotic breeds. *(pause)* Careful, Pontius. Pets that bite get put down.

Pilate walks past them toward the inner chambers.

**SENATOR** *(CONT'D)*  
*(calling after)*  
You can wash the blood off your hands, Pontius. But not out of your veins.

---

**INT. SEJANUS'S VILLA - PRIVATE CHAMBER - LATER**

Opulent beyond measure. Sejanus's private training room. Four GLADIATORS lie groaning on the floor. Pilate stands over them, knuckles bleeding, breathing hard.

LUCIUS AELIUS SEJANUS (38) emerges from shadow. The second most powerful man in Rome has the eyes of a patient predator.

**SEJANUS**  
Feel better?

**PILATE**  
I didn't come here to feel better.

**SEJANUS**  
No? Then why request this meeting?

**PILATE**  
Because you're the only man in Rome who doesn't care that I'm Samnite.

**SEJANUS**  
Oh, I care. I care very much. *(circling him)* I care that every blow you strike is an apology. Every victory a plea: 'See? I'm Roman now.'

Pilate's breathing steadies but his eyes remain wild.

**SEJANUS** *(CONT'D)*  
The Senate gave you their usual welcome, I hear. And before that? Your homecoming?

Pilate tenses. How does he know?

**SEJANUS** *(CONT'D)*  
My informants are everywhere, Pontius. Even in mountain villages. Even in sacred caves. They say you visited your grandfather's shrine.

---

**FLASHBACK - INT. MOUNTAIN SHRINE - NIGHT (THREE DAYS EARLIER)**

We're back in the cave. The Young Samnite's blade is at Pilate's throat.

**YOUNG SAMNITE**  
*(in Oscan, subtitled)*  
We should kill you here. Let your Roman blood feed our grandfather's altar.

**PILATE**  
*(in Oscan, subtitled)*  
Do it then. But know that Rome will burn every mountain village in response. Your children will curse your name.

An OLD SAMNITE enters the shrine, leaning on a staff.

**OLD SAMNITE**  
*(in Oscan, subtitled)*  
Let him go.

**YOUNG SAMNITE**  
But grandfather—

**OLD SAMNITE**  
*(studying Pilate)*  
He's already dead. Look at his eyes. Rome killed him years ago. This is just the corpse walking. *(to Pilate)* You're Gaius's grandson. I knew your grandfather. Fought beside him at the Colline Gate.

**PILATE**  
*(in Oscan)*  
Then you know he died for nothing.

The old man STRIKES Pilate with his staff. Pilate takes it, doesn't retaliate.

**OLD SAMNITE**  
He died for freedom. You live for slavery. *(spits)* You're nothing. Neither Roman nor Samnite. A ghost pretending to be a man.

They leave him alone at the altar. Pilate kneels, draws his pugio, cuts his palm. Blood drips on stone.

**PILATE**  
*(starting in Oscan, switching to Latin mid-sentence)*  
I am your blood, grandfather. But ego sum... I am Roman. Because that is the only power left in this world.

He places his military commendation on the altar, then takes it back.

**PILATE** *(CONT'D)*  
No. I earned this. With Roman blood. My blood.

He leaves the shrine. Thunder rolls overhead.

---

**BACK TO SEJANUS'S VILLA:**

**SEJANUS**  
Did you find what you were looking for in those mountains?

**PILATE**  
I found what I already knew. That I have no people.

**SEJANUS**  
Perfect. Because I need someone with no past for what comes next. *(pause)* Judaea.

**PILATE**  
The career graveyard.

**SEJANUS**  
Or resurrection. Four prefects in twelve years, all broken by those stiff-necked Jews and their invisible god. But you... you're already broken. That makes you perfect.

Sejanus pours wine, offers it.

**SEJANUS** *(CONT'D)*  
Succeed there, and I'll make sure no one ever calls you Samnite again. Your children will be Romans. True Romans. Your family name will be carved in marble, not whispered in shame.

**PILATE**  
I have no family. No wife.

**SEJANUS**  
That's the other matter. My cousin, Claudia Procula. Great-granddaughter of Augustus himself.

**PILATE**  
The mad girl who has visions?

**SEJANUS**  
The woman whose veins carry divine blood. Illegitimate, yes, but gods don't care about marriage contracts. Marry her, and your Samnite stain dissolves in imperial purple.

**PILATE**  
She's refused twelve suitors.

**SEJANUS**  
Because they were whole men. She needs someone broken. Like her. *(pause)* She sees things, Pontius. In dreams. Perhaps she'll see something in you worth saving.

---

**ACT TWO**

**INT. PILATE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT**

Sparse military lodgings. Pilate stands before a trunk, pulling out items. At the bottom, wrapped in cloth - pieces of a broken Samnite gladius. His grandfather's sword.

He holds the pieces, weighing them in his hands. The weight of generations.

MARCUS (35), his aide, enters.

**MARCUS**  
The Imperial reception. You should prepare.

Pilate wraps the sword pieces back in cloth. But instead of returning them to the trunk, he sets them aside. A decision forming.

**PILATE**  
Marcus, what do you know of Claudia Procula?

**MARCUS**  
They say she predicted her father's death. To the day. They say she dreams of futures that come true.

**PILATE**  
And her bloodline?

**MARCUS**  
Augustus's seed, they whisper. Through his daughter Julia's exile. Scandal and divinity mixed. *(pause)* Sir, if I may... she's dangerous. Prophets always are.

**PILATE**  
I'm not afraid of dreams, Marcus.

**MARCUS**  
Perhaps you should be.

---

**INT. PILATE'S QUARTERS - LATER**

Pilate shaves carefully before a bronze mirror. In the reflection, he sees his grandfather's jaw, his grandfather's eyes. He nicks himself. Blood wells.

**FLASHBACK - INT. CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT (15 YEARS EARLIER)**

YOUNG PILATE (13) holds the same Samnite gladius, whole then. His FATHER enters, drunk, furious.

**FATHER**  
*(in Latin)*  
What are you doing with that?

**YOUNG PILATE**  
*(in Oscan)*  
Grandmother says it's our—

His father STRIKES him, hard.

**FATHER**  
Speak Latin! Only Latin! Your grandmother is dead. That language is dead. That sword is dead!

He takes the gladius, tries to break it over his knee. It bends but won't break fully. He throws the pieces in the corner.

**FATHER** *(CONT'D)*  
We survive by forgetting! By becoming them! There is no other way!

Young Pilate bleeds from his mouth, silent.

**FATHER** *(CONT'D)*  
*(grabbing him)*  
Say it. Say 'I am Roman.'

**YOUNG PILATE**  
*(in Latin)*  
I am Roman.

**FATHER**  
Again!

**YOUNG PILATE**  
I am Roman!

**FATHER**  
Good. Now forget everything else. Everything.

---

**BACK TO PRESENT:**

Pilate wipes the blood from his jaw. Perfect shave now. Perfect Roman appearance.

---

**INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT**

Opulence as religion. Every surface declares divinity. SENATORS, MERCHANTS, OFFICERS circle in careful clusters, each conversation a negotiation.

Pilate enters in his best toga - military decorations visible but not ostentatious. Conversations pause. Whispers follow him like smoke.

**WHISPERS**  
"The Samnite..."  
"Sejanus's new pet..."  
"Heard he went native in Germania..."  
"Blood will tell..."

Across the room, standing alone despite the crowd: CLAUDIA PROCULA (23).

She's everything the room is not - still among the motion, simple among the ornate. Dark hair like a Vestal Virgin's, but eyes that have seen too much for innocence. She watches the crowd like a physician studying a plague.

Their eyes meet across the room.

She doesn't look away.

Neither does he.

He approaches. The crowd parts, watching. She waits, perfectly still.

**CLAUDIA**  
You're the one who screams in Oscan when he kills.

Not a question.

**PILATE**  
You're the one who screams in her sleep when she dreams.

**CLAUDIA**  
What do you dream of, Pontius Pilate?

**PILATE**  
Nothing. I've learned not to dream.

**CLAUDIA**  
Liar. *(stepping closer)* You dream of mountains. Blood on ancient stones. Grandfathers who won't stay buried.

He's stunned. How could she know?

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
I dreamed of you last night. Before we met. You were washing your hands in a mountain stream, but the water turned to blood. You kept washing but couldn't get clean.

**PILATE**  
What else did you see?

**CLAUDIA**  
A king who wore his crown like a wound. A question that echoed in an empty hall. And you, standing between two worlds, understanding neither.

She touches his face, fingers tracing the healing cut above his eye.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
Your own people did this. Three nights ago. They rejected you.

**PILATE**  
How do you—

**CLAUDIA**  
Because I recognize the wound. My own family exiled me. Divine Augustus's bastard line. Too valuable to kill, too dangerous to keep close. *(pause)* We're the same, you and I. Trapped between worlds, belonging to neither.

**PILATE**  
I belong to Rome.

**CLAUDIA**  
No. You belong to Sejanus. There's a difference. *(studying him)* He's promised you Judaea.

**PILATE**  
If I marry you.

**CLAUDIA**  
A province of religious madmen for two broken bloodlines. How poetic.

The crowd watches them, scandalized by their intimacy. She doesn't care.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
I'll make you a bargain, Pontius Pilate of nowhere. Marry me. Go to Judaea. Build your reputation on the bodies of zealots and prophets. But when the moment comes - and we'll both know it when it does - remember that once, long ago, you knew the answer to the question you'll be asked.

**PILATE**  
What question?

**CLAUDIA**  
If I knew that, I'd be a god, not a god's bastard. *(pause)* All I know is that when it comes, the answer will matter more than your life. More than Rome. More than anything.

**PILATE**  
And if I don't know the answer?

**CLAUDIA**  
Then you'll become exactly what your grandfather's ghost fears. A Roman. Nothing more, nothing less. And that nothing will be your everything.

A SERVANT approaches with wine. Claudia takes two cups, hands one to Pilate.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
Do you know what I dreamed last week? An old man on an island, jumping at shadows. A powerful man floating in the river. And you, alone in a foreign land, trying to wash away something that won't wash clean.

**PILATE**  
Dreams are just—

**CLAUDIA**  
My dreams are never *just* anything. *(pause)* The powerful man - he had a ring like Sejanus wears. But the river had taken it.

**CLAUDIA**  
Today. But power is water, Pontius. It flows, it shifts, it drowns those who grasp too tightly. *(drinks)* Marry me or don't. But know that I've already seen how your story ends.

She starts to leave.

**PILATE**  
How does it end?

**CLAUDIA**  
*(turning back)*  
With a question you can't answer. And water that won't wash clean.

She disappears into the crowd. Sejanus materializes beside him.

**SEJANUS**  
Well?

**PILATE**  
She's insane.

**SEJANUS**  
Yes. But is she useful?

**PILATE**  
She sees things. Knows things.

**SEJANUS**  
Perfect for Judaea. The Jews claim their god sees all. Let's send them a governor's wife who actually does. *(pause)* You'll marry within the month. Sail immediately after.

**PILATE**  
And if she's right? About the future she sees?

**SEJANUS**  
Then you'll adapt. It's what survivors do.

---

**ACT THREE**

**EXT. ROME - STREETS - BEFORE DAWN**

Pilate walks alone through empty streets. He carries a leather satchel, holding it carefully, like something sacred or dangerous. The Temple of Mars looms ahead.

**INT. TEMPLE OF MARS - DAWN**

Pilate kneels before the altar, alone in the vast space. His words echo.

**PILATE**  
Father Mars, god of our fathers... *(pause)* No. You're not the god of my fathers. My fathers prayed to Mamers, to mountain spirits, to gods Rome has forgotten.

He stands, paces. Reaches into a leather satchel he's carried. We don't see what he withdraws.

**PILATE** *(CONT'D)*  
But they're dead. Their gods are dead. Only you remain. So I offer you this—

He places something on the altar. The CAMERA stays on his face, not the offering.

**PILATE** *(CONT'D)*  
The last of what I was. Take it. Make me what I must become.

A PRIEST emerges from shadows. Sees what's on the altar. His eyes widen slightly - this is significant, unexpected.

**PRIEST**  
That's... an unusual offering.

**PILATE**  
For an unusual request.

**PRIEST**  
*(studying the altar, then Pilate)*  
This is... *(pause)* Do you know what you're asking?

**PILATE**  
I'm asking for victory.

**PRIEST**  
*(long pause, almost pitying)*  
The god of war feeds on conflict, Pontius. Not its resolution. What you've placed here... this isn't an offering. It's an amputation.

**PILATE**  
Then let me bleed.

The priest shakes his head slowly.

The priest studies him.

**PRIEST**  
You're the Samnite. Sailing for Judaea.

**PILATE**  
I'm a Roman. Sailing for Judaea.

**PRIEST**  
*(smiling slightly)*  
If you say so. *(pause)* A word of advice? Their god is peculiar. He demands remembering. Every slight, every sin, every covenant. They say he never forgets.

**PILATE**  
Then I'll teach them the Roman virtue of forgetting.

**PRIEST**  
Many have tried. Their terraced hills are fertilized with Roman ambition.

---

**INT. CLAUDIA'S CHAMBERS - DAY**

Spartan despite her lineage. Claudia sits at a window, watching the street below. Pilate enters without announcement.

**CLAUDIA**  
*(without turning)*  
You've decided.

**PILATE**  
You knew I would.

**CLAUDIA**  
I knew you had no choice. Sejanus owns you. Your ambition owns you. Your shame owns you. *(turning)* The question is: what owns me?

**PILATE**  
Your dreams?

**CLAUDIA**  
My dreams are the only free thing about me. *(standing)* Do you know why I've refused twelve suitors?

**PILATE**  
Tell me.

**CLAUDIA**  
Because I saw their futures. Comfortable. Predictable. Roman. *(approaching him)* But you... your future is a storm. Darkness and lightning and choices that echo through eternity.

**PILATE**  
You're not afraid?

**CLAUDIA**  
I'm terrified. But terror is better than the slow death of a senator's wife in Rome.

She moves to a basin, pours water from a pitcher. Gestures for him to come closer.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
Your hand.

He hesitates, then extends his left hand - wrapped in linen from the mountain shrine wound. She takes it gently, begins unwinding the dressing. The linen is stained with dried blood.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
*(as she unwraps)*  
You did this yourself. At your grandfather's altar.

Not a question. She knows. The last of the linen falls away, revealing the knife cut across his palm, partially healed.

She guides his hand over the basin, pours water over it. The water runs pink, then clear. She washes carefully, tenderly - more like a sacrament than medical care.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
Clean hands. But the blood remembers.

She dries his palm with fresh linen, then pulls out a small knife. Looks into his eyes.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
This will hurt.

**PILATE**  
Everything hurts.

She reopens the wound with surgical precision. Fresh blood wells. Then, without breaking eye contact, she cuts her own palm. Firm. Decisive.

**CLAUDIA**  
Blood to blood. We're bound now. Whatever comes.

Their blood mingles, drips to the floor.

**PILATE**  
The priests would call this sacrilege.

**CLAUDIA**  
The priests know nothing of the divine. *(pressing their wounds together)* But we will. In Judaea. We'll see God face to face.

**PILATE**  
There are no gods. Only power.

**CLAUDIA**  
*(smiling sadly)*  
Oh, my broken Samnite. You're about to learn how wrong you are.

---

**INT. SEJANUS'S VILLA - NIGHT**

Final meeting. Sejanus hands Pilate sealed orders.

**SEJANUS**  
Your authority in Judaea. Use it well.

**PILATE**  
Any specific instructions?

**SEJANUS**  
Keep the peace. Collect the taxes. And remind those Jews that their god kneels to Rome, not the other way around.

**PILATE**  
And if their prophets disagree?

**SEJANUS**  
Then you remind them that Rome crucifies all challengers. Even divine ones.

They share a laugh. But something in Sejanus's eyes is deadly serious.

**SEJANUS** *(CONT'D)*  
I mean it, Pontius. They await their promised king. Their deliverer. If he appears - when he appears - you know what to do.

**PILATE**  
Kill him.

**SEJANUS**  
Make an example of him. Something so horrific that they'll fear even hoping for salvation. *(pause)* Can you do that? Kill hope itself?

**PILATE**  
I killed my own grandfather's memory. Hope should be easier.

**SEJANUS**  
Good. *(clasping his shoulder)* Remember - in Judaea, you're not Pontius the Samnite. You're my hand. My will. My judgment.

**PILATE**  
I understand.

**SEJANUS**  
Do you? Because if you fail, if you show weakness, if you let their prophets seem greater than Rome's power... I'll crucify you myself. After I've crucified your wife.

The threat hangs between them.

**PILATE**  
I won't fail.

**SEJANUS**  
No. You won't. Because failure would prove what the Senate whispers - that Samnite blood always betrays Rome in the end.

---

**EXT. PORT OF OSTIA - DAWN**

The ship *Fortuna* waits. Pilate and Claudia stand at the rail as Rome shrinks behind them.

**CLAUDIA**  
Do you ever wonder if the future is fixed? If my dreams show what will be, or what might be?

**PILATE**  
I don't wonder. I act.

**CLAUDIA**  
And if your actions are already written? If you're sailing toward a fate you can't escape?

**PILATE**  
Then I'll meet it as a Roman.

**CLAUDIA**  
Or as a Samnite.

He looks at her sharply.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
You can break the sword, Pontius. You can change the name. You can speak their language and wear their armor. But blood remembers. Blood always remembers.

**PILATE**  
My blood remembers nothing.

**CLAUDIA**  
*(touching his face)*  
Then why do you still dream in Oscan?

He pulls away, disturbed. She's right - he does.

**CLAUDIA** *(CONT'D)*  
I told you. I see everything. Even the dreams you hide from yourself.

The coastline of Italy fades. Ahead, only sea.

**PILATE**  
What do you see in Judaea?

**CLAUDIA**  
Water. Always water. You washing and washing but never getting clean. And a man asking you something you can't answer.

**PILATE**  
What does he ask?

**CLAUDIA**  
I don't know. The dream always ends before you speak. Or perhaps... perhaps the silence is your answer.

A SAILOR calls out:

**SAILOR**  
Fair winds, Prefect! We'll make Caesarea in two weeks!

Pilate acknowledges him, then turns back to the sea.

**PILATE**  
*(to himself)*  
Two weeks to become someone else.

**CLAUDIA**  
You've been trying to become someone else your whole life. *(pause)* What if in Judaea, you finally become yourself?

**PILATE**  
Then God help whoever stands in my way.

Thunder rumbles on the horizon. Storm clouds gathering.

**CLAUDIA**  
*(softly)*  
Or God help you.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**END OF EPISODE**

---

## CLOSING MOMENTS

**INT. MOUNTAIN SHRINE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)**

We return to the opening scene, now seeing its conclusion.

The Young Samnite lowers his blade.

**YOUNG SAMNITE**  
*(in Oscan, subtitled)*  
Go then. Return to your masters. But know this - when Rome falls, and it will fall, your name will be remembered as the clan that helped destroy it.

**PILATE**  
*(in Oscan, then Latin)*  
When Rome falls, there will be nothing left. Including memory.

He leaves the shrine. The Samnites watch him go.

**OLD SAMNITE**  
*(to the others)*  
He's more dangerous than any Roman.

**YOUNG SAMNITE**  
Why?

**OLD SAMNITE**  
Because he has nothing left to lose. Not even himself.

**FINAL SHOT:**

**INT. TEMPLE OF MARS - ALTAR - DAY**

The temple is empty now. Sunlight streams through columns, illuminating the altar.

CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN on what lies there, abandoned:

The broken Samnite gladius. His grandfather's sword, in two pieces. The metal still gleams despite its age, the Oscan inscriptions on the hilt still visible.

The offering Rome's god wouldn't take. Or couldn't.

It lies there like a corpse. Like a promise. Like a curse.

The CAMERA continues pushing in until the broken blade fills the frame, then—

**FADE OUT.**

**END OF PILOT**
