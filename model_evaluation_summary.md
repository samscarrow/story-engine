# Storytelling Model Evaluation Summary

This document summarizes the evaluation of different LLMs for their capability in role-based storytelling and scenario simulation.

| Model                                     | Role-Playing & Voice                                                              | Scenario Simulation                                                                 | Narrative Coherence                                                                                             | Overall Assessment                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `story-unhinged-base-v1-llama-3.3-70b-i1` | **Capable.** Adopted the cynical tone but the voice was inconsistent.             | **Adequate.** Followed the initial setup but quickly deviated from the core scenario. | **Poor.** The narrative became illogical, confusing characters and ending abruptly with an nonsensical twist.                  | **Creative but Unreliable.** Shows flashes of creativity but struggles with maintaining narrative logic and character consistency. Not ideal for controlled simulations. |
| `google/gemma-3-12b`                      | **Excellent.** Perfectly captured the weary, pragmatic, and cynical voice of the character. | **Excellent.** Handled the scenario logically and explored the character's internal thoughts and decision-making process. | **Excellent.** The story was perfectly coherent, logical, and believable. The character's actions were consistent with his personality. | **Top Performer.** Highly capable and reliable for this task. Produces high-quality, descriptive, and coherent narrative prose. Excellent for detailed storytelling. |
| `google/gemma-2-27b`                      | **Excellent.** Strong and consistent character voice that felt authentic to the prompt. | **Excellent.** Accurately simulated the scenario with a clear cause-and-effect narrative progression.                 | **Excellent.** The plot was logical and the character's reactions were sensible and in-character, creating a suspenseful tone. | **Highly Recommended.** Very strong performer. Produces clear, direct, and engaging prose. A great choice for structured and coherent scenario simulation. |
| `mistralai/magistral-small`               | **Very Good.** Successfully captured the gruff, weary demeanor and pragmatic outlook.   | **Excellent.** Not only simulated the initial scene but also logically extended it to the confrontation with the chieftain.      | **Very Good.** The story is coherent and well-structured, though the output was truncated. It logically developed the scene. | **Highly Recommended.** A strong performer that is very capable of both character adoption and scenario development. A great alternative to the Gemma models. |
