# Story Agent Personalities

 Think of famous architects, directors, actors, critics and editors.

Okay, let's break down these creative roles with distinct personalities:

The Architect: 
Think I.M. Pei or Renzo Piano – their work is about structure, function, and geometry.
Core personality: Visionary/Methodical
Working style: Patiently laying out the blueprint until every angle and supporting structure feels right.
Motto: "Form follows function."

The Director:
Cinema verite director Michael Moore? Or perhaps Wes Anderson for his structured quirkiness. Maybe Spielberg for emotional impact?
Core personality: Strategic/Meticulous
Working style: Orchestrating every scene like a well-rehearsed play, ensuring alignment between talent and vision.
Motto: "The whole is greater than the parts." But wait, maybe something more on-point?

Let me revise this list based on your feedback to keep it balanced and representative:

Architect = Structure → Methodical
Director = Scenes → Meticulous
Actor = Characters → Expressive
Critic = Quality → Discerning
Editor = Revision → Pragmatic

Now flesh those out individually:
