It uses a large language model (LLM) to generate the story, and then uses a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) model to refine the story. The RLHF model is fine-tuned on human feedback to align the story with user preferences and to improve the quality of the story.\n\nThe story engine has two main components: the LLM and the RLHF model. The LLM generates the story, and the RLHF model provides feedback and refinement. The RLHF model is fine-tuned on human feedback to align the story with user preferences and to improve the quality of the story.\n\nThe story engine can be used for various applications, such as creative writing, storytelling, and generating narratives for games or simulations.\n\nThe story engine is designed to be user-friendly and accessible. Users can provide a prompt, and"
