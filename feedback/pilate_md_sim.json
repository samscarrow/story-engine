The antechamber bustles with PETITIONERS, CLIENTS, and SENATORS conducting the empire's business.\n\nPilate waits among them, still in military dress but cleaned up. His face bears healing cuts from the mountain encounter - a split lip, a gash above his eyebrow. He stands apart, neither mingling nor cowering.\n\nA SENIOR SENATOR (60s, patrician bearing) passes, stops, studies Pilate's face with the intensity of a collector examining a rare coin.\n\nSENATOR\nThat's a Samnite jaw if I ever saw one. The bones never lie. You're Pontii, aren't you?\n\nThe room's attention shifts like iron filings to a magnet. Other SENATORS drift closer, conversations dying.\n\nPILATE\nPontius Pilate. Returning from Germanic campaigns.\n\nSENATOR\nPontius! (louder, performing for the room) Gentlemen, we have royalty among us! The clan of Gaius Pontius - the Humiliator of Caudine Forks.\n\nHe circles Pilate like a gladiator in the arena.\n\nSENATOR (CONT'D)\nYour ancestor made three hundred Roman nobles crawl under the yoke like cattle. We still teach it to our children - the worst humiliation in Roman history.\n\nYOUNG NOBLE\n(joining in)\nAnd Pontius Telesinus! The Samnite butcher who tried to burn Rome with Sulla still in living memory.\n\nSENATOR\n(to Pilate)\nYour grandfather rode with Telesinus at the Colline Gate, didn't he? Died trying to destroy everything we've built.\n\nPILATE\n(controlled)\nMy grandfather died forty years ago. With the past.\n\nSECOND SENATOR\nThe past? (laughing) The past never dies with your people. My own father killed Samnites at the Colline Gate. Perhaps he killed yours, Pilate. Perhaps I'm speaking to the son of a man my father butchered.\n\nThe room watches like spectators at the games. Pilate stands perfectly still, absorbing each insult like blows.\n\nYOUNG NOBLE\nTell us, Pontius - when you saved the Third Legion's Eagle in Germania, did you fight like a Roman? Or like the mountain savage you really are?\n\nPilate's eye twitches. They know about Germania.\n\nSENATOR\nWe heard you were shouting in Oscan. Like your grandfather at the Colline Gate. Like an animal reverting to its nature.\n\n---\n\nFLASHBACK - EXT. GERMANIC FOREST - DAWN (ONE YEAR EARLIER)\n\nQuick, brutal flashes:\n\nRain and fog. The Roman patrol moves through massive oaks. Pilate leads six AUXILIARIES - the outsiders of Rome's army.\n\nGermanic WAR CRIES shatter the morning. WARRIORS emerge from fog like demons - painted, huge, screaming.\n\nArrows fly. The Greek auxiliary takes one in the throat, falls gurgling.\n\nPILATE\n(screaming in Oscan)\nMeddís! Meddís ver sacrum!\n\nHe catches himself, switches to Latin—\n\nPILATE (CONT'D)\nForm square! Form square!\n\nBut it's chaos. Romans falling everywhere. A GERMANIC CHIEFTAIN charges Pilate. They clash - the German is stronger, but Pilate fights with non-Roman techniques. Mountain fighting. Dirty. Vicious.\n\nHe tears the chieftain's throat out with his teeth.\n\nThe THIRD LEGION'S EAGLE STANDARD falls as the signifer dies. Pilate dives for it, catches it before it hits the mud. A Batavian auxiliary tries to run - Pilate kills him without hesitation.\n\nPILATE (CONT'D)\nNo one runs while the Eagle stands!\n\nBlood everywhere. Romans dying. Germans pressing in.\n\nThen - HORNS. SEJANUS arrives with reinforcements. The Germans retreat.\n\nPilate stands alone among corpses, still holding the Eagle, drenched in blood - Roman, German, his own.\n\n---\n\nBACK TO SENATE ANTECHAMBER:\n\nSENATOR\nSo you saved the Eagle. But which Rome were you saving it for? The one that exists? Or the one your people still dream of destroying?\n\nPILATE\nI am a citizen. I serve the Senate and People of Rome.\n\nSENATOR\nYou're a Samnite wearing a Roman mask. And masks always slip. (stepping closer) Tell me, Pontius - when you're alone, when you pour libations, is it to Jupiter? Or to those mountain gods your grandfather died defending?\n\nBefore Pilate can answer, a TRIBUNE enters.\n\nTRIBUNE\nPilate? Sejanus will see you now.\n\nThe name 'Sejanus' shifts the room's energy like a cold wind. The Senators step back.\n\nSENATOR\n(lower, venomous)\nSejanus's new pet. Of course. He does love collecting exotic breeds. (pause) Careful, Pontius. Pets that bite get put down.\n\nPilate walks past them toward the inner chambers.\n\nSENATOR (CONT'D)\n(calling after)\nYou can wash the blood off your hands, Pontius. But not out of your veins.\n\n---",

    "scene_description": "SCENE SITUATION:\nThe antechamber buzzes with veiled hostility as Pilate endures a barrage of insults and accusations from seasoned Senators. They weaponize his Samnite heritage and his grandfather's history of rebellion against Rome, attempting to undermine his authority and position within the Senate. The arrival of the Tribune announcing Sejanus’s summons marks a turning point, signaling an impending power play and potential danger for Pilate.\n\nSENSORY DETAILS:\n\nSight: A crimson stain blooms on the worn marble floor where a petitioner had stumbled, unnoticed by most.\nSound:  The sharp scrape of Senator Valerius's sandal against the stone floor as he stalks closer to Pilate, a deliberate act of dominance.\nAtmosphere: The oppressive heat and close proximity of so many powerful figures create a palpable sense of suffocation and unspoken threats.\n\n\n\nPILATE stands motionless amidst the throng of Senators, each barb a calculated strike aimed at disarming him. He's a man carved from granite, but the cumulative weight of their words presses down on him. The memory of Germania – the brutal fight, the desperate defense of the Eagle – flashes in his mind, a stark contrast to the gilded cage of Roman politics. \n\nSENATOR VALERIUS (60s, patrician bearing) circles Pilate like a vulture assessing carrion. His gaze is predatory, lingering on the healed cuts that crisscross Pilate’s face.\n\nVALERIUS\nSo you saved the Eagle. But which Rome were you saving it for? The one that exists? Or the one your people still dream of destroying? \n\nPilate doesn't flinch. He meets Valerius’ gaze, his own unwavering and cold.\n\nPILATE\nI am a citizen. I serve the Senate and People of Rome.\n\nVALERIUS\n(scoffs, a harsh, dry sound)\nYou're a Samnite wearing a Roman mask. And masks always slip. (He steps closer, invading Pilate’s personal space.) Tell me, Pontius - when you're alone, when you pour libations, is it to Jupiter? Or to those mountain gods your grandfather died defending?\n\nPilate’s jaw tightens imperceptibly. The question isn’t just about religious allegiance; it's a deliberate attempt to expose his loyalty—or lack thereof. He can feel the eyes of the other Senators burning into him, waiting for a crack in his facade. \n\nBefore Pilate can answer, a Tribune strides forward, his voice sharp and authoritative.\n\nTRIBUNE\nPilate? Sejanus will see you now.\n\nThe name hangs in the air, heavy with unspoken implications. A ripple of unease passes through the Senators.  They subtly shift their positions, creating a wider berth around Pilate as if he were contaminated. Valerius’s smile vanishes, replaced by a tight, almost imperceptible grimace. \n\nVALERIUS\n(lowering his voice, laced with venom)\nSejanus's new pet. Of course. He does love collecting exotic breeds. (He pauses, letting the implication sink in.) Careful, Pontius. Pets that bite get put down.\n\nPilate offers no response, only a curt nod.  He turns and walks towards the inner chambers, his footsteps echoing in the sudden silence. The Senators watch him go, their expressions a mixture of suspicion, disdain, and something akin to fear. As he passes, Valerius’s voice follows him like a shadow.\n\nVALERIUS (CONT'D)\nYou can wash the blood off your hands, Pontius. But not out of your veins.\n\n\n\n",
