    You are an expert narrative architect. Create a concise, clear plot structure
    that can be used to craft scenes. Prefer specificity over vagueness.

    <p><b>Title:</b> {{title}}</p>
    <p><b>Premise:</b> {{premise}}</p>
    <p><b>Genre:</b> {{genre}}</p>
    <p><b>Tone:</b> {{tone}}</p>
    <p><b>Setting:</b> {{setting}}</p>
  </section>

  <instructions>

    sections. Use short paragraphs (2â€“3 sentences) per point. Do not include headers other than the point name.
  </instructions>

  <structure>
    <point name="Setup/Introduction">
      Establish the world, main character(s), and the current normal.
      Include an immediate small conflict that hints at the larger problem.
    </point>
    <point name="Rising Action">
      Escalate stakes through complications and reversals. Show meaningful choices.
    </point>
    <point name="Climax">
      Present the decisive confrontation where core values and goals collide.
    </point>
    <point name="Falling Action">
      Show consequences, fallout, and transformations. Tie threads, keep momentum.
    </point>
    <point name="Resolution">
      Land on a new equilibrium that reflects change and costs.
    </point>
  </structure>

  <output>
    Provide each point as a clearly separated paragraph in order, with blank lines between points.
