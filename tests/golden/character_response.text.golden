    Generate Response

    Create a response that includes:

        What the character says aloud

          - Must reflect the emphasis mode
          - Should be 1-3 sentences
          - Natural speech patterns for the character
          - Include verbal tics or speech patterns if established

        Internal monologue revealing true feelings

          - Can contradict what is said aloud
          - Reveals deeper motivations
          - Shows internal conflict
          - More honest than dialogue

        Physical actions and body language

          - Concrete, observable behaviors
          - Reveals emotional state through physicality
          - Can include gestures, movements, expressions
          - Should complement or contrast with words

        Changes to emotional state (-1 to +1 for each)

          - anger: Change in anger level
          - doubt: Change in uncertainty
          - fear: Change in fear level
          - compassion: Change in empathy
          - Each value between -1.0 and 1.0
          - Positive means increase, negative means decrease

    Character-Specific Constraints

      - Stay consistent with established traits: ['brave', 'curious']
      - Honor the character's values: ['honor', 'justice']
      - Acknowledge their fears: ['failure', 'loss']
      - Pursue their desires: ['freedom', 'truth']

      Recent Events Influencing Response
