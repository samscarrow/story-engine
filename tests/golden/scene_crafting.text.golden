    Story Context

        What Just Happened

          This scene should flow naturally from the previous events while escalating or shifting the dramatic tension.

          The world and its rules
          The immediate situation
          The central conflict or question
          The mood and tone

    Scene Creation Instructions

      Essential Elements

        Location and Time
        Provide specific details about:

          Exact location (not just "a room" but "the prefect's private chamber")
          Time of day and how it affects the scene
          Environmental conditions that add pressure or atmosphere

        Immediate Conflict or Tension
        Clearly establish:

          Why this moment cannot be avoided or delayed
          What forces are in opposition
          What decision or action is required

        What's at Risk
        Make clear:

          What each character stands to gain or lose
          The immediate consequences of action/inaction
          The broader implications for the story

            ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a turning point - stakes must be life-changing

        Character Expression Opportunities
        Ensure the scene allows characters to:

          Reveal their true nature through choices
          Express their unique voice and perspective
          Interact meaningfully with others
          Face their fears or desires

    Sensory Details

      After describing the situation, provide THREE specific sensory details that enhance the scene:

        Visual Detail:
        One striking visual element that captures the scene's essence
        The flickering torchlight casting dancing shadows on stone walls

        Auditory Detail:
        A sound that adds tension or atmosphere
        The distant roar of the crowd growing louder

        Atmospheric Detail:
        A feeling, smell, or environmental element
        The oppressive heat making everyone's tempers shorter

    Response Format

      Provide your response in this structure:

      SCENE SITUATION (2-3 sentences):
      [Describe the immediate situation with specific location, time, and conflict]

      SENSORY DETAILS:

        Sight: [One vivid visual detail]
        Sound: [One evocative sound]
