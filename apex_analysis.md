  - Quality evaluation dashboard

### 3. **Analytics & Insights Platform** üìä

**Medium-High Value**: Deep analysis of story generation:

- **Generation Analytics**
  - Model performance comparisons
  - Quality metrics over time
  - Cost tracking per story/character
  - Success rate monitoring

- **Content Analysis**
  - Character development tracking
  - Narrative coherence scoring
  - Theme and tone analysis
  - Audience engagement metrics

- **Process Optimization**
  - Bottleneck identification
  - Resource utilization analysis
  - Model efficiency comparisons
  - Automated improvement suggestions

### 4. **Collaboration & Workflow Platform** üë•

**Medium Value**: Enable team-based story development:

- **Multi-user Environment**
  - User roles and permissions
  - Collaborative editing capabilities
  - Review and approval workflows
  - Comments and feedback system

- **Project Management**
  - Story project organization
  - Task assignment and tracking
  - Deadline and milestone management
  - Progress reporting

## Technical Integration Strategies

### Option 1: **Direct Database Integration** (Recommended)
```sql
-- APEX can directly query story engine tables
SELECT workflow_name, output_data, timestamp 
FROM story_db.workflow_outputs 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Real-time dashboard updates
CREATE VIEW story_dashboard AS 
SELECT 
    w.workflow_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_runs,
    MAX(w.timestamp) as last_run,
    AVG(json_value(w.metadata, '$.quality_score')) as avg_quality
FROM workflow_outputs w 
GROUP BY w.workflow_name;
```

### Option 2: **REST API Integration**
```python
# Create APEX REST services to interact with story engine
@app.route('/api/story/generate', methods=['POST'])
def generate_story():
    # Trigger story generation from APEX
    result = story_engine.generate_story(request.json)
    return jsonify(result)

# APEX can call these APIs via JavaScript or PL/SQL
```

### Option 3: **Hybrid Approach** (Best)
- Direct database queries for real-time data display
- REST APIs for complex story generation operations
- Background job integration for long-running workflows
