# Character Simulation Engine - Story Engine

A production-ready character behavior simulation system that generates authentic narrative content through psychological modeling rather than templated writing.

## 🎭 What We Built

**Core Engine:**
- `character_simulation_engine_v2.py` - Production character simulation with LLM abstraction
- `simulation_config.yaml` - Comprehensive configuration system
- `cache_manager.py` - Performance optimization through caching
- `test_character_simulation.py` - Complete test suite (28 tests ✅)

**Experiments:**
- `experiment.py` - Basic character behavior exploration
- `advanced_experiment.py` - Complex scenarios and character variants
- `dramatic_emotional_journey.py` - Emotional evolution through story sequences  
- `interactive_experiment.py` - Interactive character playground
- `real_llm_emotional_sequence.py` - Real LLM integration with emotional tracking
- `lmstudio_setup_guide.py` - LMStudio setup and model recommendations

## 🚀 Key Features

### Character Psychology System
- **Emotional States**: Anger, doubt, fear, compassion, confidence with dynamic evolution
- **Memory System**: Thread-safe character memory with event tracking
- **Internal Conflicts**: Complex psychological tensions and motivations
- **Trait-based Behavior**: Character responses based on personality traits and values

### LLM Integration
- **Multiple Providers**: MockLLM (testing), OpenAI, LMStudio (local models)
- **Structured Output**: JSON schema enforcement for consistent responses
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Caching**: Performance optimization for repeated scenarios

### Production Features
- **Async Concurrency**: Configurable concurrent simulation limits
- **Configuration Management**: YAML-based settings for all parameters
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance testing
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

**Most Dramatic Changes:**
- **DOUBT**: 📈 0.80 (confident → completely uncertain)
- **FEAR**: 📈 0.70 (calm → terrified)  
- **CONFIDENCE**: 📉 0.70 (authoritative → broken)
- **COMPASSION**: 📈 0.40 (dutiful → empathetic)

## 🎯 Character Simulation Examples

### Different Emphasis Modes
- **Power**: "Enough! I am the authority here! This man dies if I say he dies!"
- **Doubt**: "What is truth? You speak as one who knows certainties I cannot grasp..."
- **Fear**: "The crowd grows restless! If I don't act, Rome will have my head!"
- **Compassion**: "I find no fault in this man. Surely there must be another way..."

### Character Variants Tested
- **The Ruthless Administrator**: High anger/confidence, low compassion
- **The Tormented Idealist**: High doubt/compassion, philosophical responses
- **The Coward**: High fear, survival-focused decisions

## 🧪 How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Basic experiment
python experiment.py

## 🤖 LLM Setup for Real Testing

### Recommended Models for Character Simulation:
1. **Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Best overall choice
2. **Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Fast and efficient  
3. **Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Creative responses
4. **Phi-3.5-Mini-Instruct** ⭐⭐⭐ - Compact and fast

### LMStudio Setup:
1. Download LMStudio from https://lmstudio.ai/
2. Load a recommended model
3. Start local server (localhost:1234)
4. Enable structured output in settings
5. Run `python lmstudio_setup_guide.py` to test

## 📊 Performance Stats

## 🎨 Character Creation System

### Define Characters with:
```python
character = CharacterState(
    id="unique_id",
    name="Character Name",
    backstory={"origin": "...", "career": "..."},
    traits=["trait1", "trait2"],
    values=["value1", "value2"],
    fears=["fear1", "fear2"],
    desires=["desire1", "desire2"],
    emotional_state=EmotionalState(anger=0.3, doubt=0.7, ...),
    memory=CharacterMemory(),
    current_goal="Character's objective",
    internal_conflict="Core psychological tension"
)
```

### Generate Responses:
```python
result = await engine.run_simulation(
    character,
    situation="Your scenario here",
    emphasis="power|doubt|fear|compassion|duty",
    temperature=0.8
)
```

## 🏆 What Makes This Special

### Authentic Narrative Generation
- **Psychology-First**: Characters driven by internal states, not templates
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Emotional states change based on story events
- **Contextual Memory**: Characters remember and reference past events
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Same situation generates different responses based on emphasis

### Production Ready
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry and fallback systems
- **Performance**: Caching, concurrency limits, resource management
- **Testing**: Full test coverage with mocking and integration tests
- **Configuration**: Flexible YAML-based configuration system

### Research Applications
- **Narrative Psychology**: Study how characters evolve through story events
- **Decision Making**: Explore how emotional states influence choices
- **Character Development**: Test different personality combinations
- **Interactive Fiction**: Dynamic character responses for games/stories

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Connect Real LLM**: Follow LMStudio setup guide for realistic responses
2. **Create New Characters**: Build your own character templates
3. **Design Story Sequences**: Create emotional journey experiments
4. **Integrate into Projects**: Use as backend for interactive fiction or games
5. **Extend Psychology Model**: Add new emotional dimensions or memory types

The system is ready for both experimentation and production use - from character psychology research to powering dynamic narrative experiences!
