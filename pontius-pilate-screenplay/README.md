# Pontius Pilate: The Calculus of Survival

A sophisticated psychological drama exploring the collision between rational calculation and ultimate truth through the lens of Pontius Pilate's encounter with Jesus of Nazareth.

## Synopsis

This screenplay presents Pontius Pilate as a Roman engineer-administrator who approaches human problems with the same systematic precision that made him successful in infrastructure projects. His survival-based decision-making algorithms prove increasingly inadequate when confronted with moral complexities that cannot be calculated or manipulated.

The story traces Pilate's psychological journey from confident mathematical certainty through growing awareness that his analytical frameworks miss the most important human realities, culminating in his recognition that some truths transcend calculation entirely.

## Character Framework

**Pontius Pilate** - A Roman administrator who:
- Applies engineering precision to political and human problems
- Uses mathematical risk assessment for all major decisions
- Maintains survival through calculated compliance versus resistance
- Has "forbidden thoughts" about system corruption he cannot articulate
- Employs physical constants: controlled breathing, measured gestures, strategic pauses

**Claudia Procula** - Pilate's wife who:
- Experiences prophetic dreams that defy rational explanation
- Represents intuitive wisdom that challenges analytical certainty
- Serves as voice of conscience and deeper understanding

**Jesus of Nazareth** - The central figure who:
- Embodies truth as absolute rather than political resource
- Represents authority beyond calculation or manipulation
- Forces Pilate to confront the limits of his worldview
